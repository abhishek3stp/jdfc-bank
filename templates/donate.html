    <h1>Save Families From COVID-19</h1>
    <p>
        The Coronavirus pandemic has caused devastation across the globe. Besides
        the tragic toll on human life, with countries shutting their borders and
        quarantines, economies have taken a huge hit. The tragedy has just begun to
        unfold in India and the job losses are mounting, especially among the daily
        wage workers. Experts say the effect on this group will be catastrophic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Coronavirus is an international disaster on the scale of the Second World
        War. We have launched this campaign as an emergency response - to help
        provide a safety net to casual labour families. We aim to directly support
        these families by providing a minimum wage in cash, hopefully with your
        support till the virus abates and they are in employment again. These
        unemployed individuals have been duly verified by GiveIndia.The whole world
        is suffering - and is trying to cope with huge losses. But those without any
        job security or savings are the most vulnerable. Give generously to those
        hardest hit by COVID-19.
